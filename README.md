# Rescue-MyData

Rescue:My Data is a Java application that has two sub-parts
1. Paramedic Portal 
2. Patient Portal

**Paramedic Portal** will be used by Emergency services to pull out patient
details by only using the unique 5 digit patient ID that is generated at the time of
patient registration. The paramedic portal is secured by user id and password
which will be generated for only specific users (emergency services providers).

**Patient Portal** will be used by the general public to save and register the data
for emergency situations. The patient portal enables the user to either access their
data by using their registered password and generated patient ID, or register their
data in the portal.
